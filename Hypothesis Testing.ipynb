    "The permutation test is a statistical test that involves rerunning the study many times and recalculating the test statistic for each iteration. The goal is to calculate a distribution of the test statistics over these many iterations. This distribution is called the sampling distribution and it approximates the full range of possible test statistics under the null hypothesis. We can then benchmark the test statistic we observed in the data (a mean difference of 2.52) to determine how likely it is to observe this mean difference under the null hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is true, that the weight loss pill doesn't help people lose more weight, then the observed mean difference of 2.52 should be quite common in the sampling distribution. If it's instead extremely rare, then we should reject the null hypothesis instead.\n",
    "To simulate rerunning the study, we randomly reassign each data point (weight lost) to either group A or group B. We keep track of the recalculated test statistics as a separate list. By re-randomizing the groups that the weight loss values belong to, we're simulating what randomly generated groupings of these weight loss values would look like. We then use these randomly generated groupings to understand how rare the groupings in our actual data were.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the number of times we re-randomize the groups that each data point belongs to matches the total number of possible permutations. Usually, the number of total permutations is too high for even powerful supercomputers to calculate within a reasonable time frame. While we'll use 1000 iterations for now, in later lessons we'll learn how to quantify the tradeoff we make between accuracy and speed to determine the optimal number of iterations.\n",
